Create color grading 3D LUTs for Smash Ultimate. Learn more about how these textures work and the effects that can be achieved in the 
[post processing page](https://scanmountgoat.github.io/Smush-Material-Research/post_processing) of the Smash Ultimate material website. A windows executable is available in 
[Releases](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/Smush-LUT/releases).

## Usage Instructions
1. Find the nutexb file to edit. The color grading luts are typically called `color_grading_lut.nutexb` and can be found in the stage's `render\` folder.
Drag the nutexb onto `smush_lut.exe` to generate a PNG version of the LUT.
2. Edit the generated PNG image in an image editor like Photoshop, Gimp, etc. Only use adjustments or layers that affect the entire image such as levels, curves, exposure, gradient maps, etc. The LUT can't store the changes in the image made by brushes or image overlays. 
3. Drag the edited PNG image onto `smush_lut.exe` to create a nutexb from the edits made to the image.  
4. Replace the stage's `color_grading_lut.nutexb` with the one generated by `smush_lut.exe`. The file size will be 1:1 with the original, so there usually won't be any issues compressing it to the correct size. Most edits to 8 bit images introduce some subtle banding artifacts, which also helps with compression. 
5. There may be some inconsistencies in how the LUT appears in game due to the way the post processing pass is implemented, so repeat from step 1. with the edited nutexb as needed.

## Previewing Color Grading LUTs
Convert the LUT to a 16x16x16 .cube file using the executable. 
Example: `smush_lut.exe sepia.png sepia.cube` or `smush_lut.exe sepia.nutexb sepia.cube`. 
Cube files can be opened in many video editing and image editing software. Photoshop and Affinity Photo support important and exporting LUTs as .cube files. Other image editing software may have plugins that support .cube files. 

### Photoshop (CS6 or later)
Create a new color lookup adjustment layer by clicking the adjustment layer icon on the layers panel and selecting "Color Lookup". 
Click the "Load 3D LUT" dropdown and then click "Load 3D LUT" again to open a file dialog to select the .cube file exported earlier. Leave the color channel settings at default. 

### Affinity Photo 
Similar to Photoshop, create a new LUT adjustment layer by clicking the adjustment layer icon and selecting "LUT". Click "Load LUT" and select the .cube file exported earlier.
